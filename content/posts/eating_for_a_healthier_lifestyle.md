Healthy eating also means replacing foods containing trans fats, salt and sugar with more nutritious alternatives.

Dietary advice can help you lose and maintain a healthy body weight by the consumption of healthy foods, drinks, snacks and regular physical activity. Combining physical activity with your diet can also help you achieve and maintain a healthy weight, reduce risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease and promote overall health and well-being. A healthy diet doesn't have to be a strict restriction to stay thin or deprive yourself of the foods you love.

The good news is that eating right is not hard or requires you to give up the foods you love. Instead, focus on adding healthy foods to your diet, rather than eating unhealthy foods.
